# What you should prepare for linting TypscScript

You use VsCode to dev? Well, let me to tell you how to configure this lint
function in VsCode.

First thing you must know is that VsCode has extensions to highlight the
errors/warnings while you're coding. `ESList` is one of them. Then the another
is `Prettier - Code formatter`. And the third one is `EditorConfig for Vs Code`.

Just install them!

To lint Typescript, you may think you need a `TSLint` extension. No! ESLint &
Prettier cover everything NOW!

Secondly, you should install some npm packages. Look below! ðŸ‘‡

```json
	"devDependencies": {
		"@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^2.27.0",
		"@typescript-eslint/parser": "^2.27.0",
		"eslint": "^6.8.0",
		"eslint-config-prettier": "^6.10.1",
		"eslint-plugin-prettier": "^3.1.2",
		"prettier": "^2.0.4",
		"typescript": "^3.8.3"
	}
```

What are them for?

Sorry, I'm hungry now.
